    <h1 id="myName">Jason Mollet</h1>

    <p>My name is Jason Mollet. This is my third year at <span>SWIC</span>, but my second year pursuing an associate's degree in web development. 
        I took an introductory class to learn more about the back end of computers and fell in love with learning how to build websites. 
        I have been attending school full-time while also working full-time in construction. However, 
        I am now trying to look for an internship because I feel that I have gained enough knowledge to start gaining practical experience. Also, it is a requirement at <span>SWIC</span> 
        to have an internship to graduate. 
    </p>
    
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities that keep me engaged and constantly learning.</p>
